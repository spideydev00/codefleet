# Express Customer Support

An Express REST API that wraps CodeFleet's `runTasks()` explicit-DAG pipeline behind a single `POST /tickets` endpoint. A three-agent pipeline runs on every request:

1. **classifier** (`claude-haiku-4-5-20251001`) — categorises the ticket and assigns urgency
2. **drafter** (`claude-sonnet-4-6`) — writes a polished customer-facing reply (depends on classifier)
3. **qa-reviewer** (`claude-opus-4-7`) — reviews the draft for tone and accuracy (depends on classifier + drafter)

`runTasks()` is the right primitive here because the pipeline shape is fixed: a coordinator-decomposed `runTeam()` would re-derive the same DAG and pay for an extra synthesis call on every request. With `runTasks()` the dependency graph is declared once at the route handler and CodeFleet executes it in topological order, writing each agent's output into the next agent's prompt via the `## Context from prerequisite tasks` block that `runTasks()` injects from each completed task's result.

Each agent uses a Zod `outputSchema`; the endpoint assembles the three structured results into one JSON response. Each agent's model **and** provider are independently swappable via env vars so a free-tier setup can mix providers (see [Swapping providers](#swapping-providers) below).

## Setup

```bash
cd examples/integrations/express-customer-support
npm install
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...    # default — all three agents use Anthropic
```

## Start the server

```bash
npm start
# Support API listening on http://localhost:3000
```

## Send a ticket

```bash
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:3000/tickets \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"subject":"My order never arrived","body":"I placed order #12345 two weeks ago and it still has not shipped. Please help!"}' | jq .
```

Expected response shape:

```json
{
  "category":    "shipping",
  "urgency":     "high",
  "draft_reply": "Thank you for reaching out...",
  "qa_notes":    "Tone is empathetic and professional. Accuracy: ..."
}
```

## Smoke test

Runs a real request against a local server (requires `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`):

```bash
npm run smoke
```

Exits 0 and prints the structured response on success, exits 1 on failure.

## HTTP error codes

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| 200 | Pipeline completed; body matches the `SupportTicketResponse` schema |
| 400 | Invalid JSON body, or missing / non-string `subject` / `body` fields |
| 502 | Pipeline failed, an agent produced no structured output, or an LLM call threw |
| 504 | Pipeline exceeded the 60-second timeout (in-flight LLM calls are aborted) |

## Environment variables

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | *(required for default provider)* | Anthropic API key |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | — | Required if `openai` is selected for any agent |
| `GEMINI_API_KEY` | — | Required if `gemini` is selected for any agent |
| `XAI_API_KEY` | — | Required if `grok` is selected for any agent |
| `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` | — | Required if `deepseek` is selected for any agent |
| `GITHUB_TOKEN` | — | Required if `copilot` is selected for any agent |
| `MINIMAX_API_KEY` | — | Required if `minimax` is selected for any agent |
| `AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY` | — | Required if `azure-openai` is selected for any agent |
| `CLASSIFIER_PROVIDER` | `anthropic` | Provider for the classifier agent |
| `CLASSIFIER_MODEL`    | `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001` | Model for the classifier agent |
| `DRAFTER_PROVIDER`    | `anthropic` | Provider for the drafter agent |
| `DRAFTER_MODEL`       | `claude-sonnet-4-6` | Model for the drafter agent |
| `QA_PROVIDER`         | `anthropic` | Provider for the QA reviewer agent |
| `QA_MODEL`            | `claude-opus-4-7` | Model for the QA reviewer agent |
| `PORT` | `3000` | Port the server listens on |

Supported `*_PROVIDER` values with startup key validation: `anthropic`, `openai`, `gemini`, `grok`, `deepseek`, `copilot`, `minimax`, `azure-openai`. Providers not in this list are supported by the framework but are not mapped in this file's startup check — a missing key will surface as a 502 mid-request rather than a startup error.

## Swapping providers

The defaults run the full pipeline on Anthropic across the cheap/mid/strong tier. Each agent can be moved to a different provider independently — useful when only some providers offer a free tier.

Run the cheap classifier on Gemini's free tier and keep the rest on Anthropic:

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
export GEMINI_API_KEY=...
export CLASSIFIER_PROVIDER=gemini
export CLASSIFIER_MODEL=gemini-2.5-flash
npm start
```

Run the entire pipeline on OpenAI:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
export CLASSIFIER_PROVIDER=openai CLASSIFIER_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini
export DRAFTER_PROVIDER=openai    DRAFTER_MODEL=gpt-4o
export QA_PROVIDER=openai         QA_MODEL=gpt-4o
npm start
```

If the API key for a chosen provider is missing, the server fails fast at startup with a clear message rather than erroring during a request.
