# Context Management

Long-running agents can hit input token ceilings fast. Set `contextStrategy` on `AgentConfig` to control how the conversation shrinks as it grows:

```typescript
const agent: AgentConfig = {
  name: 'long-runner',
  model: 'claude-sonnet-4-6',
  // Pick one:
  contextStrategy: { type: 'sliding-window', maxTurns: 20 },
  // contextStrategy: { type: 'summarize', maxTokens: 80_000, summaryModel: 'claude-haiku-4-5' },
  // contextStrategy: { type: 'compact', maxTokens: 100_000, preserveRecentTurns: 4 },
  // contextStrategy: { type: 'custom', compress: (messages, estimatedTokens) => ... },
}
```

| Strategy | When to reach for it |
|----------|----------------------|
| `sliding-window` | Cheapest. Keep the last N turns, drop the rest. |
| `summarize` | Send old turns to a summary model; keep the summary in place of the originals. |
| `compact` | Rule-based: truncate large assistant text blocks and tool results, keep recent turns intact. No extra LLM call. |
| `custom` | Supply your own `compress(messages, estimatedTokens)` function. |

## Compressing Tool Results

Tool outputs persist in the conversation history across turns even after the agent has acted on them. In long runs this can consume a significant portion of the context budget.

`compressToolResults` replaces already-consumed tool results (those followed by an assistant response) with a short marker before each new LLM call:

```typescript
const agent: AgentConfig = {
  name: 'long-runner',
  model: 'claude-sonnet-4-6',
  // Enable with the default threshold (500 chars):
  compressToolResults: true,
  // Or only compress results longer than N characters:
  // compressToolResults: { minChars: 2000 },
}
```

| Value | Behaviour |
|-------|-----------|
| `true` | Compress results longer than 500 characters (default threshold) |
| `{ minChars: N }` | Compress results longer than N characters |
| `false` / `undefined` | Disabled (default) |

**Notes:**
- Error tool results are never compressed.
- Delegation `tool_result` blocks (from `delegate_to_agent`) are exempt — the parent agent always retains the full sub-agent output.
- Works alongside `contextStrategy`; combine both for maximum context headroom.

## Truncating Tool Output

`maxToolOutputChars` caps the raw output length for every tool used by an agent. Outputs longer than the limit are truncated to a head + tail excerpt with a marker in between. This applies at execution time, before the result enters the conversation.

```typescript
const agent: AgentConfig = {
  name: 'long-runner',
  model: 'claude-sonnet-4-6',
  maxToolOutputChars: 10_000, // truncate any single tool output to 10 k chars
}
```

Per-tool `maxOutputChars` (set on `ToolDefinition`) takes priority over the agent-level `maxToolOutputChars`.

## Preserving Reasoning Across Providers

Reasoning models (OpenAI o-series, DeepSeek reasoner, Anthropic extended thinking, Gemini thought summaries) emit intermediate reasoning that the framework extracts as `ReasoningBlock`s with a `provenance` field identifying the producing adapter. By default, only same-provider blocks with a valid signature are echoed back; everything else is silently dropped on outbound conversion to avoid the receiving model rejecting an unsigned thinking block or to keep prompt size predictable.

`preserveReasoningAsText` opts into a `<thinking>...</thinking>` text fallback: whenever an outbound conversion encounters a reasoning block the target adapter cannot natively echo, the block is downgraded to inline text and prepended to the next assistant message:

```typescript
const agent: AgentConfig = {
  name: 'cross-provider',
  model: 'gpt-5',
  provider: 'openai',
  // Enable text fallback for reasoning blocks the target adapter can't echo.
  preserveReasoningAsText: true,
  // Defaults to ON when preserveReasoningAsText is true; head+tail truncate
  // each block to 1200 chars. Override to tune, or set false to disable.
  // compressReasoningText: { minChars: 4000 },
}
```

When the fallback fires:

| Source provenance | Target adapter capability | Behaviour with `preserveReasoningAsText: true` |
|---|---|---|
| Matches target (`'anthropic'` → Anthropic) and has signature | `'own-issued'` | Native echo (unchanged) |
| Matches target but no signature | `'own-issued'` | Text fallback |
| Foreign (e.g. `'openai'` → Anthropic) | `'own-issued'` | Text fallback |
| Matches target (`'deepseek'` → DeepSeek) in a tool-calling conversation | `'tool-use-only'` | Native `reasoning_content` echo (per DeepSeek V4 spec, see #251) |
| Matches target but no `tool_use` anywhere in history | `'tool-use-only'` | Dropped (DeepSeek spec ignores non-tool reasoning) |
| Foreign (e.g. `'openai'` → DeepSeek) | `'tool-use-only'` | Text fallback |
| Matches target (`'bedrock'` → Bedrock) and has signature or is redacted | `'own-issued'` | Native echo via `reasoningContent.{reasoningText,redactedContent}` (see #223) |
| Any | `'never'` (OpenAI, Azure, Copilot, AI SDK, etc.) | Text fallback |

Redacted reasoning (Anthropic safety-filtered) emits the placeholder `<thinking>[redacted]</thinking>` to signal that reasoning occurred without leaking the opaque payload.

**Notes:**
- Disabled by default to avoid silently inflating prompt tokens.
- Default-on truncation (`compressReasoningText`) is mandatory for safety on long chain-of-thought; disable only when debugging.
- Some local OpenAI-compatible models may echo `<thinking>` text back into their assistant response, which can trip the loop detector. See `examples/patterns/cross-provider-reasoning.ts` for the failure mode and mitigations.
- Bedrock has `capabilities.echoesReasoning === 'own-issued'`: signed reasoning blocks (`reasoningContent.reasoningText.signature`) and redacted blocks (`reasoningContent.redactedContent`) round-trip natively on both `chat()` and `stream()`, in both inbound extraction and outbound serialization (see #223).
- `'tool-use-only'` (DeepSeek V4) is the only capability where same-provider echo works **without** the user opting into `preserveReasoningAsText` — it's forced on internally because the DeepSeek API requires it.
